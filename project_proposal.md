# Final Project Proposal - Junaid Ahmed
## Title: Protein Analysis Tool

### Description:
For my final project, I plan to build a web app in which the user can query
up to 5 results from a keyword and be shown detailed analyses of the protein
sequences (tabbed/on link click). I plan on using the pypdb, biopandas, and
matplotlib libraries in python to create this app.
